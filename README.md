Loans is a financial tool that offers money to the people in need but expects them to pay back later.
According to Investopedia, even if we only talk about the student loans, more than 1.4 trillion dollars
have been approved in 2019 in the U.S. However, when people cannot pay back the principal as well as
interests. <BR>
The aim of our project is to build some models that can predict whether an applicant would default or not
based on their financial information from the Kaggle dataset like credit scores, loan history, etc. We
believe the project is essential to the banks who issue loans and to the borrowers who take the loans. If
our models can accurately predict the default behaviors, not only can it prevent the bank from issuing bad
loans and taking losses, but it also stops the applicants who are about to default from bankruptcy. The
banks are also able to provide other low-risk options for those applicants.
